# Playing with mazes

I'm working my way through [Mazes for programmers](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
and trying out some of the concepts in elm.

```
npm install
npm run dev # live reloading dev server at http://localhost:8000/
npm run debug # dev server with debuger (slow)
npm run build # prod build to public/
```

Pushed to `main` are auto-deployed to
[netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/blaix-mazes/overview)
and available at <https://blaix-mazes.netlify.app/>

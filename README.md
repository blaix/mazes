# Playing with mazes

I'm working my way through [Mazes for programmers](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
and trying out some of the concepts in elm.

Run by [installing elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html)
and running `elm reactor` in this directory
and navigating to the elm source files.
